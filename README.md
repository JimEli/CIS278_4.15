# Pima CC CIS278 Week #2 4.15 Exercise

A large company pays its salespeople on a commission basis. The salespeople each receive $200 per week plus 9% of their gross sales for that week. For example, a salesperson who sells $5000 worth of chemicals in a week receives $200 plus 9% of $5500, or a total of $650. Develop a C++ program that uses a while statement to input each salesperson’s gross sales for last week and calculates and displays that salesperson’s earnings. Process one salesperson’s figures at a time.
